/* Addition Test

	The following tests test
	the following:
	1. Simple addition
	2. Note pitch change
	3. Chord pitch change
	4. Sequence pitch change with a chord
	5. Note mixing (this makes a chord)
	6. Note mixing (with left associativity,
		this first makes a chord with A and B
		and then makes two chords with A and C
		and B and C)
	7. Chord mixing (the LHS becomes three chords
		that each include D)
	8. Chord mixing (Elements sharing an index
					will combine to make new chords)
